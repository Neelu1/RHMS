<H1>RHMS: Remote Health management system</H1>
 It is a low cost and portable system which consists of e-Health sensor platform for rural health monitoring with various medical parameters. The device has an Arduino UNO kit and shield along with various health sensors like ECG, GSR, Blood Pressure etc. which is connected to a PC using USB.  It has a well-structured and secure interface between Doctor and Remote centre for data exchange with a sophisticated PC Software developed in Lab-VIEW. This device has an intelligent capability of performing a general diagnosis of the patient and generating a prescription on the internet using Machine Learning thus relaxing Doctors from monitoring every physical parameter.	A patient can have a one to one interaction with doctor by chat/video call if the data required are not sufficient. This unit also has the responsibility of transmitting the sensed data to the remote environment for storage and diagnosis of the patient.
 Thus, HEMAN can fulfil all the requirements of Tele-medical health care systems for both urban and rural areas with its sophisticated features.
